# SwiftyJoystick
This is an example of joystick controller using swift

It's very simple and easy to use you just have to copy JoyStickClass.swift to your project and create an object in your view controller
The initializer takes many parameters , position of the stick , size of the view , size of the stick 

Dont forget to attach the gesture recognizer to the joystick object from the target viewcontroller and attach the UIPanGestureRecognizer to joystickobject using appendGestureRecognizerToStick() function
